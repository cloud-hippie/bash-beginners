# LPI Lesson Plan

This is the repo that contains notes for users of the LPI course. It is a collection of snippets of code that are used to teach the course.

Students will be able to use these snippets to learn how to use the Linux Kernel and how to build a simple Linux system.

They should pair these notes, scripts and code together to create a working system and study for the LPI Linux Essentials exam.

# Chapter 1 - Introduction To Linux

Chapter 1 covers distirbutions and package managers and is recommended for all students. Getting a graps on the distirbutions and package managers is the first step in learning Linux.

# Chapter - 2 - Linux Kernel
