# Chapter 1 - Introduction To Linux

The Linux Operating system is inspired by the Unix Operating System.

Unix was created by the BSD group in 1969.


# Distributions

Distribution - bundle that consits of the Linux Kernel and a selection of utilities that are maintained by company or user community.

Each distribution falls under a distirbution family.

The distirbution family is the group of distributions that share the same kernel.

Depending on the distirbution family, the distirbution will either use dpkg or rpm to install packaged onto the system.

## Debian Distribution

The following distirbutions use the dpkg package manager:

- Debian GNU/Linux - the biggest distribution of Linux of the Debian family.

- Ubuntu - aims to be a complete replacement of Debian. Its mission is to provide a complete and stable replacement of Debian to everyone in order to lower the cost of deploying and building software.

## RPM Distribution

- Red Hat - Linux distribution maintained by Red Hat. It is often abreviated as RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux). It aims to provide companies with a stable and secure Linux distribution with enterprise grade features.

- CentOS - Linux distribution maintained by the CentOS project. It aims to provide a stable and secure Linux distribution with enterprise grade features, without the support.

- Fedora - very progressive Linux distribution. It adopts new features quickly and is often used by professional developers as a test-bed for new technologies to later be included in RHEL.

# Embdedded Systems

Each of these linux disturbance families is designed to be used in an embedded system. This is one of the main reasons why Linux is popular among many developers. It can be used ANYWHERE.

Embdedded System - combination of hardware and software that is designed to be used in a specific environment within a larger system. Usually they are part of Devices and help to control these devices.

E.x. - automotive, medical, industrial, etc.

Two of the most popular embedded software projects are Android and Raspberry Pi.

Android - mainly mobile operating system developed by Google.

Raspberry Pi - is a small and cheap computer that is used to control a variety of devices
